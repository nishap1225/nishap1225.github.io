Hi! My name is Nisha Prabhakar. I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm passionate about using computer science to drive the world forward in a positive way. I love exploring computer science, and learning new ways in which I can solve problems and create tools. Some of my hobbies are reading, biking, and playing the [veena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena#:~:text=The%20veena%20(IAST%3A%20v%C4%AB%E1%B9%87%C4%81),lutes%2C%20zithers%20and%20arched%20harps.).
