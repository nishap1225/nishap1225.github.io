Word Blocker is a chrome extension to block passages which include certain words. This can be used for blocking triggers or avoiding spoilers.

Usage:

1. To block a word, enter the word into the text field and click "Submit". This will block all instances of the word. You must refresh the page before the changes take effect.
{% include aligner.html images="pexels/autonotes_website.png" column=1 %}  

2. To unblock a word, enter the word into the text field again and click "Delete". Again, the page must be refreshed.  
{% include aligner.html images="pexels/autonotes_website.png" column=1 %}
