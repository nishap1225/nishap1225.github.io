### RISC-V
<!--more-->

[***Specification:***](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj2/)

In this project, I wrote all the RISC-V assembly code necessary to run a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Venus RISC-V simulator. In part A, I implemented basic operations such as a vector dot product, matrix-matrix multiplication, the argmax and an activation function. In part B, I combined these basic functions in order to load a pretrained network and execute it to classify handwritten digets from the MNIST benchmark set.  

I used RISC-V to:
- implement computation functions
- interact with files and utilize the heap
- write a comprehensive set of tests
