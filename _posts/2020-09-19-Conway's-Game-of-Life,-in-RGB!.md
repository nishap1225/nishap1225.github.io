[***The Game of Life***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton created by John Conway.  
[***Specification***](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj1/)

In this project, I created methods to read in and write to [PPM ASCII files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example). Secondly, I decoded messages hidden with [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) in image files.   

Finally, I implemented the game of life in C.
