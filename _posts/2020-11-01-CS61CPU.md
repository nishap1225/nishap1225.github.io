### Logism
<!--more-->

In this project, I used logism to model a fully functional RISC-V CPU.   
[***Specification: ***](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj3/)

Specifically, I created:  
- an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) which supports operations such as add, mul, and, or, etc.
- a Register File
- a large portion of RISC-V's ISA by creating  
  - the memory unit
  - a branch comparator
  - an immediate generator
  - control logic
  - control status register (CSR)
  - processor
