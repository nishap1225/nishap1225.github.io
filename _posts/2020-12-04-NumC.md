[***Specification:***](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj4/#task-4-speeding-up-matrix-operations)

In this project, I first implemented a subset of `numpy` called `numc` using a naive solution for matrix operations. Then, I experimented with a setup file in Python to install the `numc` module. After that, I constructed the Python-C interface by overloading some operators and defining some instance methods for `numc.Matrix` objects. Finally, I sped up my naive solution, thus making `numc.Matrix` operations faster.  

To speed up the naive solution, I:   
- used conventional code optimizations to speed up the matrix operation algorithms themselves
- SIMD instructions, which perform operations on 256 bit values (4 64 bit operations can be performed in parallel)
- parallel computation using OpenMP, being careful to keep the threads from overwriting one another
